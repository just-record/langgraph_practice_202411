# ## Booking and Cancellation

# 1. How can I change my booking?
#         * The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).
#         * The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).
#         * There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.
#         * It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).
# 2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?
#         * Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines
#         * Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued
#         * Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route
#         * Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)
#         * Bookings with segments with a status other than OK (e.g. containing flight segments with the status Waitlist) (HK|RR)
#         * Tickets that do not display the tariff calculation (IT tickets)

# ================================== Ai Message ==================================

# You are allowed to update your flight to a later time today, as long as the following conditions are met:

# 1. Your ticket number must start with 724, which it does.
# 2. Your booking should not include flight segments with other airlines or any special services, and the ticket should not be part of a group booking.
# 3. Rebooking should be done at least three hours before the original departure time from the Swiss airport.
# 4. The fare conditions should allow changes, and the flight booking should be active, with the corresponding flight segments properly issued.

# Since your current flight is about to depart, you might not meet the three-hour advance notice required for changes. However, if you are still interested in making the change and comply with the requirements, I can help you look for available flights later today and assist in changing your booking. Would you like me to proceed with checking for available flights?
