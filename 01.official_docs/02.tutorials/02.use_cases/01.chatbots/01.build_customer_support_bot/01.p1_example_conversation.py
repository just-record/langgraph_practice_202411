# ## Booking and Cancellation

# 1. How can I change my booking?
#         * The ticket number must start with 724 (SWISS ticket no./plate).
#         * The ticket was not paid for by barter or voucher (there are exceptions to voucher payments; if the ticket was paid for in full by voucher, then it may be possible to rebook online under certain circumstances. If it is not possible to rebook online because of the payment method, then you will be informed accordingly during the rebooking process).
#         * There must be an active flight booking for your ticket. It is not possible to rebook open tickets or tickets without the corresponding flight segments online at the moment.
#         * It is currently only possible to rebook outbound (one-way) tickets or return tickets with single flight routes (point-to-point).
# 2. Which tickets/bookings cannot be rebooked online currently?
#         * Bookings containing flight segments with other airlines
#         * Bookings containing reservations, where a ticket has not yet been issued
#         * Bookings with several valid tickets for the same person and route
#         * Tickets with a status other than O (open) (A)

# ================================== Ai Message ==================================

# You can update your flight to leave later today if your ticket conditions allow for changes. Here are the key points:

# 1. **Ticket Eligibility**: Your ticket must be a SWISS ticket (starting with 724) and not paid for by voucher or barter.

# 2. **Active Booking**: You need an active flight booking for the ticket you're trying to change.

# 3. **Change Options**: You can change the flight and travel dates, but not the origin or destination.

# 4. **Rebooking Timeline**: You can rebook online up to three hours before your current departure time.

# 5. **Fare Conditions**: Check if your fare conditions allow changes; some may incur fees.

# Since your ticket number starts with 724 and you've booked a flight, you should be eligible to change it. Would you like me to find available flights for you later today?
